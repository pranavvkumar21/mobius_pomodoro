## Visual Preview

> The app displays a subtle, thin bar at the very top of your screen that gradually empties as time passes, colored green for work and purple for rest periods. Near the system tray on your taskbar, a transparent floating timer shows the remaining session time without blocking clicks. Upon session completion, a translucent full-screen overlay gently reminds you to rest or work, maintaining your workflow without harsh interruptions.
